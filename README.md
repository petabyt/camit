# Camit
Camit (CAMera InTervalometer) is a free app that can be used to control digital cameras.

This is the free and open-source version of [Cam](https://danielc.dev/cam/) made using LibUI. This app
has a bunch more limited scope, and primarly serves as an intervalometer and remote shutter. It can also run scripts
and perform basic actions.
